A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects. for example, 3124 is one possible permutation of the digits 1, 2, 3 and 4. if all of the permutations are listed numerically or alphabetically, we call it lexicographic order. the lexicographic permutations of 0, 1 and 2 are:
012   021   102   120   201   210
what is the millionth lexicographic permutation of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9?
