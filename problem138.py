"""
Consider the isosceles triangle with base length, b = 16, and legs, l = 17.


by using the pythagorean theorem it can be seen that the height of the triangle, h = (172 82) = 15, which is one less than the base length.
with b = 272 and l = 305, we get h = 273, which is one more than the base length, and this is the second smallest isosceles triangle with the property that h = b  1.
find  l for the twelve smallest isosceles triangles for which h = b  1 and b, l are positive integers.
