Consider the infinite polynomial series ag(x) = xg1 + x2g2 + x3g3 + ..., where gk is the kth term of the second order recurrence relation gk = gk1 + gk2, g1 = 1 and g2 = 4; that is, 1, 4, 5, 9, 14, 23, ... .
for this problem we shall be concerned with values of x for which ag(x) is a positive integer.
the corresponding values of x for the first five natural numbers are shown below.

xag(x)
(51)/41
2/52
(222)/63
(1375)/144
1/25

we shall call ag(x) a golden nugget if x is rational, because they become increasingly rarer; for example, the 20th golden nugget is 211345365.
find the sum of the first thirty golden nuggets.
