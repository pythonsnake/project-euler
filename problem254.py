Define f(n) as the sum of the factorials of the digits of n. for example, f(342) = 3! + 4! + 2! = 32.

define sf(n) as the sum of the digits of f(n). so sf(342) = 3 + 2 = 5.

define g(i) to be the smallest positive integer n such that sf(n) = i. though sf(342) is 5, sf(25) is also 5, and it can be verified that g(5) is 25.

define sg(i) as the sum of the digits of g(i). so sg(5) = 2 + 5 = 7.

further, it can be verified that g(20) is 267 and  sg(i) for 1 i  20 is 156.

what is  sg(i) for 1 i  150?
