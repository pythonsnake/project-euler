In a sliding game a counter may slide horizontally or vertically into an empty space. the objective of the game is to move the red counter from the top left corner of a grid to the bottom right corner; the space always starts in the bottom right corner. for example, the following sequence of pictures show how the game can be completed in five moves on a 2 by 2 grid.



let s(m,n) represent the minimum number of moves to complete the game on an m by n grid. for example, it can be verified that s(5,4) = 25.



there are exactly 5482 grids for which s(m,n) = p2, where p  100 is prime.

how many grids does s(m,n) = p2, where p  106 is prime?
