"""
Consider the right angled triangle with sides a=7, b=24 and c=25.
the area of this triangle is 84, which is divisible by the perfect numbers 6 and 28.
moreover it is a primitive right angled triangle as gcd(a,b)=1 and gcd(b,c)=1.
also c is a perfect square.

we will call a right angled triangle perfect if
-it is a primitive right angled triangle
-its hypotenuse is a perfect square

we will call a right angled triangle super-perfect if
-it is a perfect right angled triangle and
-its area is a multiple of the perfect numbers 6 and 28.


how many perfect right-angled triangles with c1016 exist that are not super-perfect?
