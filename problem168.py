Consider the number 142857. we can right-rotate this number by moving the last digit (7) to the front of it, giving us 714285.
it can be verified that 714285=5142857.
this demonstrates an unusual property of 142857: it is a divisor of its right-rotation.
find the last 5 digits of the sum of all integers n, 10 n  10100, that have this property.
