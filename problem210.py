Consider the set s(r) of points (x,y) with integer coordinates satisfying |x| + |y|  r. 
let o be the point (0,0) and c the point (r/4,r/4). 
let n(r) be the number of points b in s(r), so that the triangle obc has an obtuse angle, i.e. the largest angle α satisfies 90°
so, for example, n(4)=24 and n(8)=100.

what is n(1,000,000,000)?
