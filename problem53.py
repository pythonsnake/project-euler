There are exactly ten ways of selecting three from five, 12345:
123, 124, 125, 134, 135, 145, 234, 235, 245, and 345
in combinatorics, we use the notation, 5c3 = 10.
in general,

ncr = 
n!r!(nr)!
,where r n, n! = n(n1)...321, and 0! = 1.

it is not until n = 23, that a value exceeds one-million: 23c10 = 1144066.
how many, not necessarily distinct, values of Â ncr, for 1 n  100, are greater than one-million?
