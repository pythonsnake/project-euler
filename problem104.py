"""
The fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:
fn = fn1 + fn2, where f1 = 1 and f2 = 1.
it turns out that f541, which contains 113 digits, is the first fibonacci number for which the last nine digits are 1-9 pandigital (contain all the digits 1 to 9, but not necessarily in order). and f2749, which contains 575 digits, is the first fibonacci number for which the first nine digits are 1-9 pandigital.
given that fk is the first fibonacci number for which the first nine digits and the last nine digits are 1-9 pandigital, find k.
