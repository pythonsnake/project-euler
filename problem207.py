"""
For some positive integers k, there exists an integer partition of the form   4t = 2t + k,
where 4t, 2t, and k are all positive integers and t is a real number.

the first two such partitions are 41 = 21 + 2 and 41.5849625... = 21.5849625... + 6.

partitions where t is also an integer are called perfect. 
for any m  1 let p(m) be the proportion of such partitions that are perfect with k m.
thus p(6) = 1/2.

in the following table are listed some values of p(m)
   p(5) = 1/1
   p(10) = 1/2
   p(15) = 2/3
   p(20) = 1/2
   p(25) = 1/2
   p(30) = 2/5
   ...
   p(180) = 1/4
   p(185) = 3/13


find the smallest m for which p(m)  1/12345
