Let an be a sequence recursively defined by: . 


so the first 10 elements of an are: 1,1,0,3,0,3,5,4,1,9.

let f(n,m) represent the number of pairs (p,q) such that: 


it can be seen that f(10,10)=4 with the pairs (3,3), (5,5), (7,9) and (9,10).


you are also given that f(104,103)=97158.

find f(1012,106).
