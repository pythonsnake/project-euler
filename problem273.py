"""
Consider equations of the form: a2 + b2 = n, 0 a b, a, b and n integer.

for n=65 there are two solutions:
a=1, b=8 and a=4, b=7.
we call s(n) the sum of the values of a of all solutions of a2 + b2 = n, 0 a b, a, b and n integer.
thus s(65) = 1 + 4 = 5.
find s(n), for all squarefree n only divisible by primes of the form 4k+1 with 4k+1  150.
