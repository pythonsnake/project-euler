Consider the following configuration of 64 triangles:



we wish to colour the interior of each triangle with one of three colours: red, green or blue, so that no two neighbouring triangles have the same colour. such a colouring shall be called valid. here, two triangles are said to be neighbouring if they share an edge.
note: if they only share a vertex, then they are not neighbours. 

for example, here is a valid colouring of the above grid:


a colouring c' which is obtained from a colouring c by rotation or reflection is considered distinct from c unless the two are identical.

how many distinct valid colourings are there for the above configuration?
