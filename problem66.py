"""
Consider quadratic diophantine equations of the form:
x2 – dy2 = 1
for example, when d=13, the minimal solution in x is 6492 – 131802 = 1.
it can be assumed that there are no solutions in positive integers when d is square.
by finding minimal solutions in x for d = {2, 3, 5, 6, 7}, we obtain the following:
32 – 222 = 1
22 – 312 = 192 – 542 = 1
52 – 622 = 1
82 – 732 = 1
hence, by considering minimal solutions in x for d  7, the largest x is obtained when d=5.
find the value of d  1000 in minimal solutions of x for which the largest value of x is obtained.
