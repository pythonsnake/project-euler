"""
A composite is a number containing at least two prime factors. for example, 15 = 3  5; 9 = 3  3; 12 = 2  2  3.

there are ten composites below thirty containing precisely two, not necessarily distinct, prime factors:
4, 6, 9, 10, 14, 15, 21, 22, 25, 26.

how many composite integers, n  108, have precisely two, not necessarily distinct, prime factors?
