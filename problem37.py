"""
The number 3797 has an interesting property. being prime itself, it is possible to continuously remove digits from left to right, and remain prime at each stage: 3797, 797, 97, and 7. similarly we can work from right to left: 3797, 379, 37, and 3.
find the sum of the only eleven primes that are both truncatable from left to right and right to left.
note: 2, 3, 5, and 7 are not considered to be truncatable primes.
