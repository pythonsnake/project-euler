We shall call a fraction that cannot be cancelled down a resilient fraction. furthermore we shall define the resilience of a denominator, r(d), to be the ratio of its proper fractions that are resilient; for example, r(12) = 4⁄11.



the resilience of a number d  1 is then
φ(d)d - 1, where φ is euler's totient function.
we further define the coresilience of a number n  1 as c(n)= 
n - φ(n)n - 1.
the coresilience of a prime p is c(p)
= 
1p - 1.




find the sum of all composite integers 1 n  21011, for which c(n) is a unit fraction.


 note: the upper limit has been changed recently. check out that you use the right upper limit.
