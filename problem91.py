"""
The points p (x1, y1) and q (x2, y2) are plotted at integer co-ordinates and are joined to the origin, o(0,0), to form Î´opq.




there are exactly fourteen triangles containing a right angle that can be formed when each co-ordinate lies between 0 and 2 inclusive; that is,0 x1, y1, x2, y2 2.




given that 0 x1, y1, x2, y2 50, how many right triangles can be formed?
