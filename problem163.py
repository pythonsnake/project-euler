Consider an equilateral triangle in which straight lines are drawn from each vertex to the middle of the opposite side, such as in the size 1 triangle in the sketch below.

sixteen triangles of either different shape or size or orientation or location can now be observed in that triangle. using size 1 triangles as building blocks, larger triangles can be formed, such as the size 2 triangle in the above sketch. one-hundred and four triangles of either different shape or size or orientation or location can now be observed in that size 2 triangle.
it can be observed that the size 2 triangle contains 4 size 1 triangle building blocks. a size 3 triangle would contain 9 size 1 triangle building blocks and a size n triangle would thus contain n2 size 1 triangle building blocks.
if we denote t(n) as the number of triangles present in a triangle of size n, then
t(1) = 16
t(2) = 104
find t(36).
