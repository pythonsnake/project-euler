"""
Some positive integers n have the property that the sum [ n + reverse(n) ] consists entirely of odd (decimal) digits. for instance, 36 + 63 = 99 and 409 + 904 = 1313. we will call such numbers reversible; so 36, 63, 409, and 904 are reversible. leading zeroes are not allowed in either n or reverse(n).

there are 120 reversible numbers below one-thousand.

how many reversible numbers are there below one-billion (109)?
