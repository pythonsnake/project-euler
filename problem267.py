You are given a unique investment opportunity.
starting with £1 of capital, you can choose a fixed proportion, f, of your capital to bet on a fair coin toss repeatedly for 1000 tosses.
your return is double your bet for heads and you lose your bet for tails.
for example, if f = 1/4,  for the first toss you bet £0.25, and if heads comes up you win £0.5 and so then have £1.5. you then bet £0.375 and if the second toss is tails, you have £1.125.
choosing f to maximize your chances of having at least £1,000,000,000 after 1,000 flips, what is the chance that you become a billionaire?
all computations are assumed to be exact (no rounding), but give your answer rounded to 12 digits behind the decimal point in the form 0.abcdefghijkl.
