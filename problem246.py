A definition for an ellipse is:
given a circle c with centre m and radius r and a point g such that d(g,m)r, the locus of the points that are equidistant from c and g form an ellipse.

the construction of the points of the ellipse is shown below.





given are the points m(-2000,1500) and g(8000,1500). 
given is also the circle c with centre m and radius 15000.
the locus of the points that are equidistant from g and c form an ellipse e.
from a point p outside e the two tangents t1 and t2 to the ellipse are drawn.
let the points where t1 and t2 touch the ellipse be r and s.




for how many lattice points p is angle rps greater than 45 degrees?
