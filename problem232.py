"""
Two players share an unbiased coin and take it in turns to play "the race". on player 1's turn, he tosses the coin once: if it comes up heads, he scores one point; if it comes up tails, he scores nothing. on player 2's turn, she chooses a positive integer t and tosses the coin t times: if it comes up all heads, she scores 2t-1 points; otherwise, she scores nothing. player 1 goes first. the winner is the first to 100 or more points.

on each turn player 2 selects the number, t, of coin tosses that maximises the probability of her winning.

what is the probability that player 2 wins?

give your answer rounded to eight decimal places in the form 0.abcdefgh .
