"""
A triplet of positive integers (a,b,c) is called a cardano triplet if it satisfies the condition:



for example, (2,1,5) is a cardano triplet.


there exist 149 cardano triplets for which a+b+c  1000.


find how many cardano triplets exist such that a+b+c  110,000,000.

note: this problem has been changed recently, please check that you are using the right parameters.
