We shall define a pythagorean polygon  to be a convex polygon with the following properties:there are at least three vertices,
no three vertices are aligned,
each vertex has integer coordinates,
each edge has integer length.for a given integer n, define p(n) as the number of distinct pythagorean polygons for which the perimeter is  n.
pythagorean polygons should be considered distinct as long as none is a translation of another.

you are given that p(4) = 1, p(30) = 3655 and p(60) = 891045.
find p(120).
