"""
A number consisting entirely of ones is called a repunit. we shall define r(k) to be a repunit of length k; for example, r(6) = 111111.
given that n is a positive integer and gcd(n, 10) = 1, it can be shown that there always exists a value, k, for which r(k) is divisible by n, and let a(n) be the least such value of k; for example, a(7) = 6 and a(41) = 5.
the least value of n for which a(n) first exceeds ten is 17.
find the least value of n for which a(n) first exceeds one-million.
