We shall define a square lamina to be a square outline with a square "hole" so that the shape possesses vertical and horizontal symmetry.
given eight tiles it is possible to form a lamina in only one way: 3x3 square with a 1x1 hole in the middle. however, using thirty-two tiles it is possible to form two distinct laminae.


if t represents the number of tiles used, we shall say that t = 8 is type l(1) and t = 32 is type l(2).
let n(n) be the number of t  1000000 such that t is type l(n); for example, n(15) = 832.
what is  n(n) for 1 n  10?
