"""
A number consisting entirely of ones is called a repunit. we shall define r(k) to be a repunit of length k; for example, r(6) = 111111.
let us consider repunits of the form r(10n).
although r(10), r(100), or r(1000) are not divisible by 17, r(10000) is divisible by 17. yet there is no value of n for which r(10n) will divide by 19. in fact, it is remarkable that 11, 17, 41, and 73 are the only four primes below one-hundred that can  be a factor of r(10n).
find the sum of all the primes below one-hundred thousand that will never be a factor of r(10n).
