"""
We shall define a sqube to be a number of the form, p2q3, where p and q are distinct primes.
for example, 200 = 5223 or 120072949 = 232613.

the first five squbes are 72, 108, 200, 392, and 500.

interestingly, 200 is also the first number for which you cannot change any single digit to make a prime; we shall call such numbers, prime-proof. the next prime-proof sqube which contains the contiguous sub-string "200" is 1992008.

find the 200th prime-proof sqube containing the contiguous sub-string "200".
