"""
For a positive integer k, define d(k) as the sum of the digits of k in its usual decimal representation.
thus d(42) = 4+2 = 6.


for a positive integer n, define s(n) as the number of positive integers k n with the following properties :
k is divisible by 23 and
d(k) = 23.

you are given that s(9) = 263626 and s(42) = 6377168878570056.


find s(1112) and give your answer mod 109.
