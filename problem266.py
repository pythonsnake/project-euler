The divisors of 12 are: 1,2,3,4,6 and 12.
the largest divisor of 12 that does not exceed the square root of 12 is 3.
we shall call the largest divisor of an integer n that does not exceed the square root of n the pseudo square root (psr) of n.
it can be seen that psr(3102)=47.


let p be the product of the primes below 190.
find psr(p) mod 1016.
