Comparing two numbers written in index form like 211 and 37 is not difficult, as any calculator would confirm that 211 = 2048  37 = 2187.
however, confirming that 632382518061 519432525806 would be much more difficult, as both numbers contain over three million digits.
using base_exp.txt (right click and 'save link/target as...'), a 22k text file containing one thousand lines with a base/exponent pair on each line, determine which line number has the greatest numerical value.
note: the first two lines in the file represent the numbers in the example given above.
