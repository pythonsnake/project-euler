"""
A number chain is created by continuously adding the square of the digits in a number to form a new number until it has been seen before.
for example,
44  32  13  10 1 1
85 89  145  42  20  4  16  37  58 89
therefore any chain that arrives at 1 or 89 will become stuck in an endless loop. what is most amazing is that every starting number will eventually arrive at 1 or 89.
how many starting numbers below ten million will arrive at 89?
