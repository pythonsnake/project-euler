Given is an integer sided triangle abc with sides a  b  c. 
(ab = c, bc = a and ac = b).
the angular bisectors of the triangle intersect the sides at points e, f and g (see picture below).




the segments ef, eg and fg partition the triangle abc into four smaller triangles: aeg, bfe, cgf and efg.
it can be proven that for each of these four triangles the ratio area(abc)/area(subtriangle) is rational.
however, there exist triangles for which some or all of these ratios are integral.


how many triangles abc with perimeter100,000,000 exist so that the ratio area(abc)/area(aeg) is integral?
