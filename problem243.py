A positive fraction whose numerator is less than its denominator is called a proper fraction.
for any denominator, d, there will be d1 proper fractions; for example, with d = 12:1/12 , 2/12 , 3/12 , 4/12 , 5/12 , 6/12 , 7/12 , 8/12 , 9/12 , 10/12 , 11/12 .


we shall call a fraction that cannot be cancelled down a resilient fraction.
furthermore we shall define the resilience of a denominator, r(d), to be the ratio of its proper fractions that are resilient; for example, r(12) = 4/11 .
in fact, d = 12 is the smallest denominator having a resilience r(d) 4/10 .

find the smallest denominator d, having a resilience r(d) 15499/94744 .
