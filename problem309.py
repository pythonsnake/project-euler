In the classic "crossing ladders" problem, we are given the lengths x and y of two ladders resting on the opposite walls of a narrow, level street. we are also given the height h above the street where the two ladders cross and we are asked to find the width of the street (w).



here, we are only concerned with instances where all four variables are positive integers.
for example, if x = 70, y = 119 and h = 30, we can calculate that w = 56.

in fact, for integer values x, y, h and 0 x y x,y,h) producing integer solutions for w:
(70, 119, 30), (74, 182, 21), (87, 105, 35), (100, 116, 35) and (119, 175, 40).

for integer values x, y, h and 0 x y x,y,h) produce integer solutions for w?
