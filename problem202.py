Three mirrors are arranged in the shape of an equilateral triangle, with their reflective surfaces pointing inwards. there is an infinitesimal gap at each vertex of the triangle through which a laser beam may pass.

label the vertices a, b and c. there are 2 ways in which a laser beam may enter vertex c, bounce off 11 surfaces, then exit through the same vertex: one way is shown below; the other is the reverse of that.


  

there are 80840 ways in which a laser beam may enter vertex c, bounce off 1000001 surfaces, then exit through the same vertex.

in how many ways can a laser beam enter at vertex c, bounce off 12017639147 surfaces, then exit through the same vertex?
