"""
A hexagonal orchard of order n is a triangular lattice made up of points within a regular hexagon with side n. the following is an example of a hexagonal orchard of order 5:






highlighted in green are the points which are hidden from the center by a point closer to it. it can be seen that for a hexagonal orchard of order 5, 30 points are hidden from the center.



let h(n) be the number of points hidden from the center in a hexagonal orchard of order n.



h(5) = 30. h(10) = 138. h(1 000) = 1177848.



find h(100 000 000).
