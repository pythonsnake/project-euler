"""
Let's call s the (infinite) string that is made by concatenating the consecutive positive integers (starting from 1)  written down in base 10. 
thus, s = 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242...


it's easy to see that any number will show up an infinite number of times in s.


let's call f(n) the starting position of the nth occurrence of n in s. 
for example, f(1)=1, f(5)=81, f(12)=271 and f(7780)=111111365.


find f(3k) for 1k13.
