An electric circuit uses exclusively identical capacitors of the same value c.

the capacitors can be connected in series or in parallel to form sub-units, which can then be connected in series or in parallel with other capacitors or other sub-units to form larger sub-units, and so on up to a final circuit.
using this simple procedure and up to n identical capacitors, we can make circuits having a range of different total capacitances. for example, using up to n=3 capacitors of 60 f each, we can obtain the following 7 distinct total capacitance values: 

if we denote by d(n) the number of distinct total capacitance values we can obtain when using up to n equal-valued capacitors and the simple procedure described above, we have: d(1)=1, d(2)=3, d(3)=7 ...
find d(18).
reminder : when connecting capacitors c1, c2 etc in parallel, the total capacitance is ct = c1 + c2 +...,

whereas when connecting them in series, the overall capacitance is given by:
