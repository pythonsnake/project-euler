Consider the number 3600. it is very special, because

3600 = 482 +     362
3600 = 202 + 2402
3600 = 302 + 3302
3600 = 452 + 7152

similarly, we find that 88201 = 992 + 2802 = 2872 + 2542 = 2832 + 3522 = 1972 + 7842.

in 1747, euler proved which numbers are representable as a sum of two squares.
we are interested in the numbers n which admit representations of all of the following four types:

n = a12 +   b12n = a22 + 2 b22n = a32 + 3 b32n = a72 + 7 b72,

where the ak and bk are positive integers.

there are 75373 such numbers that do not exceed 107.

how many such numbers are there that do not exceed 2109?
