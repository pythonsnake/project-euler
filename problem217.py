"""
A positive integer with k (decimal) digits is called balanced if its first k/2 digits sum to the same value as its last k/2 digits, where x, pronounced ceiling of x, is the smallest integer x, thus Ï€ = 4 and 5 = 5.
so, for example, all palindromes are balanced, as is 13722.
let t(n) be the sum of all balanced numbers less than 10n. 
thus: t(1) = 45, t(2) = 540 and t(5) = 334795890. 
find t(47) mod 315
