"""
The fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:
fn = fn1 + fn2, where f1 = 1 and f2 = 1.
hence the first 12 terms will be:
f1 = 1
f2 = 1
f3 = 2
f4 = 3
f5 = 5
f6 = 8
f7 = 13
f8 = 21
f9 = 34
f10 = 55
f11 = 89
f12 = 144
the 12th term, f12, is the first term to contain three digits.
what is the first term in the fibonacci sequence to contain 1000 digits?
