Let's call an integer sided triangle with exactly one angle of 60 degrees a 60-degree triangle.
let r be the radius of the inscribed circle of such a 60-degree triangle.
there are 1234 60-degree triangles for which r  100.
let t(n) be the number of 60-degree triangles for which r n, so
 t(100) = 1234,  t(1000) = 22767, and  t(10000) = 359912.

find t(1053779).
