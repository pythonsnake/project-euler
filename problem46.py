It was proposed by christian goldbach that every odd composite number can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.
9 = 7 + 212
15 = 7 + 222
21 = 3 + 232
25 = 7 + 232
27 = 19 + 222
33 = 31 + 212
it turns out that the conjecture was false.
what is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square?
