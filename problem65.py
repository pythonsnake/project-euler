The square root of 2 can be written as an infinite continued fraction.

2 = 1 +
1
 
2 +

2 +

2 +

2 + ...

the infinite continued fraction can be written, 2 = [1;(2)], (2) indicates that 2 repeats ad infinitum. in a similar way, 23 = [4;(1,3,1,8)].
it turns out that the sequence of partial values of continued fractions for square roots provide the best rational approximations. let us consider the convergents for 2.


1 +

= 3/2
 
2
 
1 +

= 7/5
 
2 +

hence the sequence of the first ten convergents for 2 are:
1, 3/2, 7/5, 17/12, 41/29, 99/70, 239/169, 577/408, 1393/985, 3363/2378, ...
what is most surprising is that the important mathematical constant,e = [2; 1,2,1, 1,4,1, 1,6,1 , ... , 1,2k,1, ...].
the first ten terms in the sequence of convergents for e are:
2, 3, 8/3, 11/4, 19/7, 87/32, 106/39, 193/71, 1264/465, 1457/536, ...
the sum of digits in the numerator of the 10th convergent is 1+4+5+7=17.
find the sum of digits in the numerator of the 100th convergent of the continued fraction for e.
