Three distinct points are plotted at random on a cartesian plane, for which -1000 x, y  1000, such that a triangle is formed.
consider the following two triangles:
a(-340,495), b(-153,-910), c(835,-947)
x(-175,41), y(-421,-714), z(574,-645)
it can be verified that triangle abc contains the origin, whereas triangle xyz does not.
using triangles.txt (right click and 'save link/target as...'), a 27k text file containing the co-ordinates of one thousand "random" triangles, find the number of triangles for which the interior contains the origin.
note: the first two examples in the file represent the triangles in the example given above.
