Consider all the triangles having:
all their vertices on lattice points.
circumcentre at the origin o.
orthocentre at the point h(5, 0).
there are nine such triangles having a perimeter  50.
listed and shown in ascending order of their perimeter, they are:

a(-4, 3), b(5, 0), c(4, -3)
a(4, 3), b(5, 0), c(-4, -3)
a(-3, 4), b(5, 0), c(3, -4)
a(3, 4), b(5, 0), c(-3, -4)
a(0, 5), b(5, 0), c(0, -5)
a(1, 8), b(8, -1), c(-4, -7)
a(8, 1), b(1, -8), c(-4, 7)
a(2, 9), b(9, -2), c(-6, -7)
a(9, 2), b(2, -9), c(-6, 7)

the sum of their perimeters, rounded to four decimal places, is 291.0089.

find all such triangles with a perimeter  105.
enter as your answer the sum of their perimeters rounded to four decimal places.
