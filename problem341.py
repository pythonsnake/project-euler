The golomb's self-describing sequence {g(n)} is the only nondecreasing sequence of natural numbers such that n appears exactly g(n) times in the sequence. the values of g(n) for the first few n are


n123456789101112131415…g(n)122334445556666…

you are given that g(103) = 86, g(106) = 6137.
you are also given that σg(n3) = 153506976 for 1 n  103.

find σg(n3) for 1 n  106.
